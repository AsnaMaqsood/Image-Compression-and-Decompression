# Image-Compression-and-Decompression
This takes and image as an input and compresses it to a smaller size using JPEG compression which is a form of lossy compression.
It carries out the following steps for compression and then reverses them for decompression:
  1.  Conversion og RGB format to YCbCr
  2.  Applying DCT
  3.  Quantization
  4.  Entropy Encoding using Huffman Coding
